#### [GUI][]
The **Graphical User Interface** (GUI /ɡuːiː/), is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

#### [GIF][]
The **Graphics Interchange Format** (better known by its acronym GIF /ˈdʒɪf/ or /ˈɡɪf/) is a bitmap image format that was developed by US-based software writer Steve Wilhite and has since come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web due to its wide support and portability.

#### [JPEG][]
JPEG (/ˈdʒeɪpɛɡ/) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.

#### [Tex][]
It's intended by its developer to be /ˈtɛx/, with the final consonant of *loch* or *Bach*.

#### [LaTex][]
It's usually pronounced /ˈleɪtɛk/ or /ˈlɑːtɛk/ in English (that is, not with the /ks/ pronunciation English speakers normally associate with X, but with a /k/).

#### [char][]
It's usually pronounced as the first syllable in *charming*, despite the fact that it's obviously an abbreviation for character.

#### [IEEE][]
The **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers** (IEEE, pronounced "I triple E") is a professional association.

#### [YAML][]
YAML (/ˈjæməl/, rhymes with mammal) is a human-readable data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being stored (e.g. debugging output) or transmitted (e.g. document headers). Originally YAML was said to mean *Yet Another Markup Language*, referencing its purpose as a markup language with the yet another construct, but it was then repurposed as *YAML Ain't Markup Language*, a recursive acronym, to distinguish its purpose as data-oriented, rather than document markup.
