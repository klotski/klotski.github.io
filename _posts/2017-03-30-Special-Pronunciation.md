[TITLE]

[GUI][]
:    The **Graphical User Interface** (GUI /ɡuːiː/), is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

[GIF][]
:    The **Graphics Interchange Format** (better known by its acronym GIF /ˈdʒɪf/ or /ˈɡɪf/) is a bitmap image format that was developed by US-based software writer Steve Wilhite and has since come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web due to its wide support and portability.

[JPEG][]
:    JPEG (/ˈdʒeɪpɛɡ/) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.

[Tex][]
:    It's intended by its developer to be /ˈtɛx/, with the final consonant of *loch* or *Bach*.

[LaTex][]
:    It's usually pronounced /ˈleɪtɛk/ or /ˈlɑːtɛk/ in English (that is, not with the /ks/ pronunciation English speakers normally associate with X, but with a /k/).

[char][]
:    It's usually pronounced as the first syllable in *charming*, despite the fact that it's obviously an abbreviation for character.

[IEEE][]
:    The **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers** (IEEE, pronounced "I triple E") is a professional association.
